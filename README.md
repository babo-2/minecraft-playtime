# Minecraft Playtime
This project extracs and graphs your minecraft **playtime**

> ⚠️ Multiple sessions running at once are overlapping playtime, so especially for me the graph **overestimates real total playtime**

> ⚠️ The graph **only shows active playtime**. When you weren’t playing (no logs) are not shown as 0 on the graph (yet), so gaps in play aren’t represented

## Features
- Extracts total playtime
- Graphs Minecraft playtime over time


## For the Future
- Split playtime per minecraft account
- Lunar Client log support (current total is from old data)
